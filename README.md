Hospital Recommendation System

Our project aims to develop a sophisticated system designed to assist critical patients in selecting the most suitable hospitals through real-time feedback. This innovative platform leverages advanced machine-learning techniques to recommend optimal healthcare facilities based on user reviews and specific disease symptoms. By analyzing and organizing user feedback effectively, our system aims to streamline decision-making processes for patients, enabling them to choose hospitals that offer the best treatment outcomes.

**1. Real-time Recommendation:** Provides immediate hospital recommendations based on current user inputs such as symptoms and geographic location.
 
**2. User Review Analysis:** Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights from user reviews, ensuring future users can make informed decisions.
 
**3. Efficiency and Accessibility:** Offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the hospital selection process, reducing decision-making time for both patients and healthcare providers.

**4. Enhanced Doctor-Patient Coordination:** Facilitates optimal scheduling by recommending hospitals aligned with the patient's needs and preferences.
